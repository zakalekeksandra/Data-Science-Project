**Multi-class wine quality classification based on physiochemical features**

Final project for the Data Science course.

The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The problem posed in this dataset is multiclass classification of wine quality.
First notebook presents data preprocessing. The second one tests various classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayesm SVM, Logisitc Regression) and evaluates their performance based on balanced and imbalanced dataset.
Dataset consits of 13 features based on physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables.

Dataset "cleaned_wine_data" is the dataset after preprocessing applied in Data_preprocessing dataset.
